# Project Name: Daily Work Task Automation with Python GUI and Playwright

## Description
This project aims to automate daily work tasks, specifically sending reports, using Python GUI and Playwright. By leveraging the power of Playwright, a cross-browser automation library, combined with a Python Graphical User Interface (GUI), this project provides an efficient and user-friendly solution to automate repetitive report sending tasks.

## Features
- **Report Generation**: The project allows users to generate reports by inputting the necessary data through a user-friendly GUI.

- **Automated Email Sending**: The project automates the process of sending reports via email, eliminating the need for manual intervention.
- **Multiple Email Providers**: Supports various email providers such as Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo, ensuring compatibility with different email platforms.
- **Attachment Support**: Users can attach files (e.g., PDFs, Excel sheets) to the reports before sending them.
- **Scheduling**: The project offers the option to schedule report sending at specific times or intervals, reducing the need for manual execution.
- **Logging and Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and error handling mechanisms are implemented to track the automation process and handle any unexpected scenarios.
